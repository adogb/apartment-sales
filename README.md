# Housing market in Copenhagen - dashboard

## What?
The subject of this on-going project is the creation of an interactive dashboard visualising the current housing market in Copenhagen (more precisely Copenhagen "Kommune"). The scope is to create a dashboard updated regularly (daily?), giving information on listings prices, sizes, number of rooms, energy mark, and more.

## Why?
Copenhagen is a costly city to live in, one of the most expensive in the world. While this project can't unfortunately do anything about this, the aim is to provide users with an overview of the market in a tailored way that common listings websites don't provide. An example of this is that average prices or other information are usually presented at commune level. Copenhagen commune is big and prices vary a lot depending on neighbourhoods (postal codes). Getting an average price per square meter for Copenhagen commune is not useful for a prospective buyer - you could expect to pay 20.000 DKK (~$3200) more or less per square meter for neighbourhoods barely 5 km from one another.

## How?
Things evolve as the project progresses but generally there are two main parts:
- web scraping of housing listings on boliga.dk, using Python (Pandas)
- data visualisation and dashboard in Microsoft Power BI
